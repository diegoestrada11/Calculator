## Overview

**Project Title**: Calculator program

**Project Description**: This is a simple console-based calculator program written in C++. 
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions like modulus, 
exponentiation, square root, cube root, and factorial calculations.

**Project Goals**: Implement a functional calculator with multiple operations.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open the project in a C++
2. Compile the project
3. Run the executable file

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run the program to display the calculator menu.
2. Enter the number corresponding to the operation you want to perform.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the required values.
4. The program will display the result of the operation.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to perform additional operations.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* C++ Compiler
* Any C++ IDE 
* Standard C++ Library (for I/O, math operations, and file handling)
